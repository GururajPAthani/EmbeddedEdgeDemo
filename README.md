That's a fantastic idea\! You overcame several tricky hurdles involving Docker, k3s's use of containerd, and container lifecycle management.

Here is the complete, consolidated, **working summary** of all the necessary steps, from writing the C code to achieving a stable, running DDS application orchestrated by k3s.

-----

## ðŸš€ Simple Container Orchestration with DDS and k3s (Working Steps)

### Step 1: Write and Test the C Code (`.c` files)

You must ensure your C applications run continuously, as containers are expected to stay running.

| File | Goal | Critical Change |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`publisher.c`** | Continuously send DDS data. | Add an **infinite loop (`while(1) { ... sleep(1); }`)** to prevent the program from exiting immediately after initialization. |
| **`subscriber.c`** | Continuously listen for DDS data. | Add a **blocking mechanism (`while(1) { sleep(10); }`)** after initialization to keep the main thread alive, allowing the DDS listener to function. |

### Step 2: Create the Docker Image

Save the `Dockerfile` in the same directory as your C files. This file must compile the code and include the necessary DDS runtime libraries.

1.  **Create `Dockerfile`:** Ensure it uses a multi-stage build (or similar) to **compile** the `.c` files into executables (`/bin/publisher` and `/bin/subscriber`).

2.  **Build the Image:** Use the exact tag you plan to use in your Kubernetes YAML.

    ```bash
    docker build -t dds-app:latest .
    ```

3.  **Verify Image:** Confirm the image is now in your local Docker store.

    ```bash
    docker images
    ```

-----

## ðŸ“¦ Step 3: Configure Kubernetes (YAML Files)

Create two YAML files, ensuring they reference your local image and instruct k3s **not** to pull from a remote registry (to resolve **`ErrImagePull`**).

1.  **`publisher-deployment.yaml`** and **`subscriber-deployment.yaml`**: Ensure both files use the exact image name and the critical pull policy:

    ```yaml
    # Critical Configuration Snippet
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: publisher-container # or subscriber-container
        image: dds-app:latest
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent  # CRITICAL for local image use
        command: ["/bin/publisher"] # or /bin/subscriber
    ```

-----

## ðŸ”Œ Step 4: Transfer Image to k3s Runtime (Resolving ImagePullBackOff)

Since k3s uses **containerd**, you must manually transfer the image from the Docker store to the k3s runtime. This resolves the persistent **`ErrImagePull`** and **`ImagePullBackOff`** issues.

1.  **Export the Docker Image:**

    ```bash
    docker save dds-app:latest -o dds_app_transfer.tar
    ```

2.  **Import to k3s/containerd:** Use the correct `k3s ctr` command (since `crictl image load` failed):

    ```bash
    sudo k3s ctr image import dds_app_transfer.tar
    ```

-----

## ðŸš€ Step 5: Deploy and Verify

Finally, apply the configuration, forcing k3s to use the newly imported image.

1.  **Clean Up Old Deployments:** Delete any previously failed or completed deployments.

    ```bash
    sudo kubectl delete deployment dds-publisher dds-subscriber-deployment
    ```

2.  **Apply New Deployments:**

    ```bash
    sudo kubectl apply -f publisher-deployment.yaml
    sudo kubectl apply -f subscriber-deployment.yaml
    ```

3.  **Verify Running Status:** Confirm the pods are stable (resolving the **`Completed`** status).

    ```bash
    sudo kubectl get pods
    # Expected Output:
    # NAME...                                 READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    # dds-publisher-...                       1/1     Running   0          <age>
    # dds-subscriber-deployment-...           1/1     Running   0          <age>
    ```

4.  **Check DDS Communication:** View the subscriber logs to confirm it's receiving data published by the publisher.

    ```bash
    # Use the label to view logs for the running subscriber pod
    sudo kubectl logs -f -l app=dds-subscriber
    ```
